MouseLock
=========

Java applet mouse lock for first person shoot games done through a web browser

Warning:
* You may finally have mouse lock support in Flash.  
* One can only imagin that HTML5 has a solution right around the corner (if not already).
* Security has always been the main issue with Mouse Lock over the inter tubes...  and the applet is no exception.  You will have to sign the applet with a certificate to make any kind of professional use out of it.

This solution is old.. however it works.  

It will also deal with some of the more subtle problems that can pleg you when going down this road.
